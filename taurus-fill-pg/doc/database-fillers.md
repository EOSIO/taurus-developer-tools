# Database Fillers

The database fillers connect to the nodeos state-history plugin and populate databases.

## PostgreSQL

* PostgreSQL
  * Supports full history
  * Partial history can fall behind on large chains; PostgreSQL sometimes struggles to delete large numbers of rows
  * Scaling: supports wasm-ql running on multiple machines connecting to a single database

## Running fillers

When running `fill-pg` for the first time, use the `--fpg-create` option to create the schema and tables. To wipe the schema and start over, run with `--fpg-drop --fpg-create`. 

After starting, a filler will populate the database. It will track real-time updates from nodeos after it catches up.

Use SIGINT or SIGTERM to stop.

PostgreSQL fill           | Default               | Description |
------------------------- |--------------------   |-------------|
--fill-connect-to         | 127.0.0.1:8080        | state-history-plugin endpoint to connect to |
--pg-schema               | chain                 | schema to use |
--fpg-drop                |                       | drop (delete) schema and tables |
--fpg-create              |                       | create schema and tables |
--fill-trim               |                       | trim history before irreversible |
--fill-skip-to            |                       | skip blocks before arg |
--fill-stop               |                       | stop filling at block arg |
--fill-trx                |                       | filter transactions |
--fpg-debug-mode          |                       | Decode key-value data on a separate table. Decode action data and return value on transaction traces.

## Transaction filters

`--fill-trx` creates a set of transaction filtering rules. It has the following syntax:

```
--fill-trx include:status:receiver:act_account:act_name
```

It ignores whitespace within the pattern.

| Field         | May be empty? | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| include       | No            | "`+`" to pass a matching action, or "`-`" to not pass |
| status        | Yes           | Transaction status. May be one of: `executed`, `soft_fail`, `hard_fail`, `delayed`, `expired` |
| receiver      | Yes           | The account which originally received the action, or the account which received a copy (`require_recipient`). |
| act_account   | Yes           | The account which received the original. This is called `code` or `first_receiver` in the CDT. |
| act_name      | Yes           | The name of the action |

`--fill-trx` may be specified multiple times. This creates a list of rules. The filter checks an action against each
rule in order. As soon as it finds a rule which matches the action it stops. The action passes if `include` is `+`. 
The action doesn't pass if `include` is `-`. If no rules match, then the action doesn't pass.

The filler writes a transaction to the database if any of the transaction's actions pass the filter. When this happens, it writes all
actions in the transaction, including ones that didn't pass.

### Transaction filter examples

* Include all transactions. Includes deferred transactions which haven't executed
  yet or have failed. This is the default if no `--fill-trx` is provided:

```
--fill-trx "+:        :            :            :"
```

* Include all executed transactions. Excludes deferred transactions which haven't executed
  yet or have failed:

```
--fill-trx "+:executed:            :            :"
```

* Include all executed transactions, but exclude some spam:

```
--fill-trx "-:        :blocktwitter:blocktwitter:"
--fill-trx "+:executed:            :            :"
```

* Include all executed transfers. Includes all token contracts:

```
--fill-trx "+:executed:            :            :transfer"
```

* Include all executed transfers. Includes only `eosio.token`:

```
--fill-trx "+:executed:            :eosio.token :transfer"
```

* Include all executed transfers which notify specific accounts. Includes all token contracts:

```
--fill-trx "+:executed:myaccount1  :            :transfer"
--fill-trx "+:executed:myaccount2  :            :transfer"
```

* Include all executed transfers which notify specific accounts. Only includes `eosio.token`:

```
--fill-trx "+:executed:myaccount1  :eosio.token :transfer"
--fill-trx "+:executed:myaccount2  :eosio.token :transfer"
```

## PostgreSQL configuration

fill-pg relies on PostgreSQL environment variables to establish connections; see the PostgreSQL manual.

A quick-and-dirty way to connect to PostgreSQL server running on another machine is to set these:
* PGUSER
* PGPASSWORD
* PGDATABASE
* PGHOST

Use the `psql` utility to verify your connection.
